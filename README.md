## Design Decisions & Aesthetic Philosophy

This Hotel Booking Engine follows a high-end, futuristic design language designed for clarity, performance, and visual impact.

### Visual Identity & Consistency

* Unified Ecosystem: The Void-Black (#000000) and Neon-Cyan (#00f3ff) palette was chosen to maintain strict architectural consistency with my existing portfolio and professional side projects. This ensures a seamless brand experience across my entire development ecosystem.
* Dark-First UX: Driven by a preference for dark-mode interfaces, the design reduces eye strain and emphasizes content hierarchy through luminous contrast rather than color fills.

### High-End Aesthetic

* Minimalist Modernism: We prioritized a clean, sharp look by removing rounded corners and traditional shadows. The UI relies on border-glows and backdrop-blur (glassmorphism) to create depth.
* Tactile Interaction: Interactive elements utilize CSS filters and "glow-scaling" on hover to provide immediate, high-fidelity feedback to the user, mimicking a powered-on electronic display.

### Technical UX Decisions

* Responsive Grid Architecture: Leveraging the Bootstrap 5 grid system, the layout is fully "fluid." The unit cards stack intelligently from a high-density 3-column desktop view to a focused single-column mobile view without losing visual hierarchy.
